## MI_Exp File Parser

This script will take items from the MI_Exp file generated by InfoGenesis and do the following:

    - Parse the items
    - Sort based on Fuzzy Finding
    - Insert sorted items into a spreadsheet using openpyxl
    - For any item that has multiple SKUs, a corresponding item on a separate tab will be created listing the SKUs down the column.

Please note, for this to work, you need to provide a MI_Exp style file. There is none provided in this repo, just processing code.

To run, make sure you have both the rapidfuzz and openpyxl modules, then just execute `python mi_parse.py`. It will prompt you for the path to the file, then run, outputting the resulting spreadsheet in the current working directory.
